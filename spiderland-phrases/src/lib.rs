//! The words and numbers an app shows, kept apart from the code that shows them so they can be translated. The
//! translations themselves are the app's, whose build script bundles them into a table of [`Catalog`]s
//! (`spiderland-phrases-build`), which [`Translations`] checks and [`Translations::select`] shows.
//!
//! Words are declared with [`phrases!`] beside the code that uses them, and used by name. Words in a table or an argument,
//! with no name worth giving, are written in place as `Phrase::new("…")`. A phrase's English is its gettext msgid, so an
//! extractor can collect the words for translators and the English stays a literal.
//!
//! A phrase that takes values names them in braces, `"Added {name}."`, and [`Phrase::with`] fills them in, so a
//! translation can move them. A count goes through a [`Plural`], whose `{n}` picks the form; a list through [`list`].
